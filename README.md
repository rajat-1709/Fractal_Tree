This Repository explains how to create a multicolor Fractal tree with python
## What are Fractals
Fractals are very complex pictures generated by a computer from a single formula. They are created using iterations. This means one formula is repeated with slightly different values over and over again, taking into account the results from the previous iteration.
## What are use of fractals
Fractals are used to model soil erosion and to analyze seismic patterns as well. Seeing that so many facets of mother nature exhibit fractal properties, maybe the whole world around us is a fractal after all! Actually, the most useful use of fractals in computer science is the fractal image compression.

<b><u>Fractals are used in many areas such as</b> −

<b>Astronomy</b> − For analyzing galaxies, rings of Saturn, etc.

<b>Biology/Chemistry</b> − For depicting bacteria cultures, Chemical reactions, human anatomy, molecules, plants,

<b>Others</b> − For depicting clouds, coastline and borderlines, data compression, diffusion, economy, fractal art, fractal music, landscapes, special effect, etc.

##  Output
By running the Given Code we get the Final fractal tree as:-
