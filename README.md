<b><u>Fractals are used in many areas such as</b> −

<b>Astronomy</b> − For analyzing galaxies, rings of Saturn, etc.

<b>Biology/Chemistry</b> − For depicting bacteria cultures, Chemical reactions, human anatomy, molecules, plants,

<b>Others</b> − For depicting clouds, coastline and borderlines, data compression, diffusion, economy, fractal art, fractal music, landscapes, special effect, etc.

##  Output
By running the Given Code we get the Final fractal tree as:-
